						<p>
							The Participatory System Mapper (PRSM) is an app that makes
							it easy for a group of people working together to
							draw networks (or 'maps') of systems. It runs in a
							web browser on a desktop PC or a tablet.
						</p>

						<p>
							The network or map can be anything that has items
							(or 'factors' or 'nodes') connected by links (or
							'edges'). Here are some examples:
						</p>

						<ul>
							<li>
								People (the nodes) connected by knowing each
								other
							</li>
							<li>
								Factors or variables causing (the links) changes
								in other factors
							</li>
							<li>Switches connected by wires</li>
							<li>Computers connected by network links</li>
							<li>
								Theories expressed as variables and
								relationships between them
							</li>
							<li>
								Company boards of directors (the nodes) and the
								directors that sit on more than one board (the
								links)
							</li>
							<li>
								Twitter hashtags (the nodes) included together
								on posts (the links)
							</li>
							<li>
								Scientists (the nodes) co-authoring papers (the
								links)
							</li>
							<li>and so on.</li>
						</ul>

						<p>
							PRSM enables groups of people, each using their
							own computer (or tablet) to collaborate in the
							drawing of a map. They may be sitting around a
							table, discussing the map as it is created face to
							face, or working remotely, using video conferencing
							or the chat feature that is built into the app.
							Everyone can participate because every edit
							(creating nodes and links, arranging them and so on)
							is broadcast to all the other participants as the
							changes are made (just as Google Docs does for text,
							for example).
						</p>

						<p>
							When you start PRSM in your browser, a 'room' is
							created for you in which to draw your network. You
							can add other users to this room to share the work.
							Only those with access to the room can see what is
							being created.
						</p>

						<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>

						<p>
							Here are a few examples of what you can do with PRSM:
						</p>

						<p>
							The first is a theory of change adapted from an
							<a
								href="https://www.thinknpc.org/resource-hub/ten-steps/"
								>NPC report</a
							>.
						</p>

						<figure>
							<img
								src="resources/NPCexample.png"
								alt="Example Theory of Change"
							/>
							<figcaption>Example Theory of Change</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							The second is a system map about the environmental
							impact of goods transport developed by a small group
							of experts working together using the app.
						</p>

								src="resources/SCandLexample.png"
								alt="Example System Map"
							/>
							<figcaption>Example System Map</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<p>
							The third is a large network of 736 nodes and about
							9000 links representing the team members playing in
							the 2019 football World Cup.
						</p>

						<figure>
							<img
								src="resources/WorldCup2019example.png"
								alt="Example social Network"
							/>
							<figcaption>Example social Network</figcaption>
						</figure>

						<h3 id="installation">Installation</h3>

						<p>
							No installation on users' computers is needed. The
							software is a web app, which means that it can be
							accessed using a web browser by pasting this link
							into the address bar:
						</p>

						<p>
							<a
								href="https://cress.soc.surrey.ac.uk/prsm/prsm.html"
								>https://cress.soc.surrey.ac.uk/prsm/prsm.html</a
							>
						</p>

						<p>
							You need a modern web browser such as Chrome,
							Firefox, Microsoft Edge or Safari. It will not work
							with Internet Explorer.
						</p>

						<hr />

						<p>
							The software is free,
							<a
								href="https://github.com/micrology/prsm"
								target="_blank"
								>open source</a
							>
							and available under an
							<a href="https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/"
								>MIT</a
							>
							license.
						</p>
